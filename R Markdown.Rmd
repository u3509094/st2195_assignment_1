This R Markdown file is created to provide introduction of previous R assignment.

In assignment 1, we have to create a R script that prints all integers between 1 and 10.

You can find the R script in my GitHub repository, [st2195_assignment_1](https://github.com/u3509094/st2195_assignment_1).

I used the [*colon operator*](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Colon.html) to generate a list of integers from 1 to 10.

```{R}
1:10
```
